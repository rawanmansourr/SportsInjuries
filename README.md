# Runners Injury Prediction 
> <p>Staying injury free is a major factor for success in sports. Our purpose was to use machine learning for the prediction of injuries in runners, based on detailed training logs.
  <br> <br> 
<b>Design</b><br>
The project will determine whether an Runner has injured or not. Data cleansing and Exploration were done before testing and evaluating models.
  <br><br>
<b>Dataset </b><br>
The data set is expected to have around 42766 rows with 13 columns.
  <br><br>
<b>Questions </b><br>
Q1. What is the main cause of sports injuries?<br>
Q2. Who are the most injured players?
  <br><br>
<b>Model Evaluation and selecting</b><br>
A few classification models were chosen to predict and classify injury.<br>
•	k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN)<br>
•	logistic regression(LR)<br>
•	Extreme Gradient Boosting(XGBoost)<br>
<br><br>
<b>Tools</b><br>
jupyter nootbook with some DS libraries such as pandas and numpy to maipulate the data, matplotlib and Matplotlib to visulalize the data and scikit learn for model for realted libraries.
