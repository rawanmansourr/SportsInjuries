# Runners Injury Prediction 
> <p>Staying injury free is a major factor for success in sports. Our purpose was to use machine learning for the prediction of injuries in runners, based on detailed training logs.
  <br>
<b>Design</b>
The project will determine whether an Runner has injured or not. Data cleansing and Exploration were done before testing and evaluating models.
  <br>
<b>Dataset </b>
The data set is expected to have around 42766 rows with 13 columns.
  <br>
<b>Questions </b>
Q1. What is the main cause of sports injuries?
Q2. Who are the most injured players?
  <br>
<b>Model Evaluation and selecting</b>
A few classification models were chosen to predict and classify depression,
•	k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN)
•	logistic regression(LR)
•	Extreme Gradient Boosting(XGBoost)
<br>
<b>Tools</b>
jupyter nootbook with some DS libraries such as pandas and numpy to maipulate the data, matplotlib and Matplotlib to visulalize the data and scikit learn for model for realted libraries.
